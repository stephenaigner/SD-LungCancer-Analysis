# SD-LungCancer-Analysis
### Description:
This is a Tableau project analyzing lung cancer death cases in San Diego, CA from 2010 - 2013. The data was sourced from a public site (see xlsx file): https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/. The interactive dashboard may be viewed here: [Tableau Data Visualizations](https://public.tableau.com/views/SanDiegoLungCancerDeaths2010-2013/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Dashboard key metrics:

* Region case count and rate
* Socioeconomic category case rate
* Age group case count and rate
* Gender case rate
* Ethnicity case rate

### Analysis:
The case rate is the number of cases per 100,000 people. The data reveals that North Inland part of San Diego had the highest case rate of 48.48 while Central has the lowest of 29.28. The lowest socioeconomic category has the highest case rate of 59.45 whereas the highest socioeconomic category has a 32.06 case rate. This reveals socioeconomic class is disproportionately affected by lung cancer deaths. As expected the age group 65+ had the highest case count and rate. There is a small difference between male and female, but it is not substantial. It was surpirsing to see there was a huge difference in ethnicity rates where hispanics had a relatively low case rate of 14.85 while Blacks had more than 4 times the case rate which was 66.5.
